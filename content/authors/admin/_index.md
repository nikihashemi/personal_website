Hi! I work at Genentech as a Global Studies Manager. I have a deep passion for creating medicines that will help people thrive. My goal is to revolutionize the healthcare industry by using R and other programming skills to implement data driven decisions that will ultimately help patients. 

When I am not playing around in R, you may find me hiking, biking, swimming, or watching sports (especially college football... FIGHT ON!)
